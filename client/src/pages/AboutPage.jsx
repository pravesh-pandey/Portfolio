          At Amazon, I work on Alexa's search infrastructure, focusing on international expansion and performance optimization.
          My responsibilities include architecting microservices, implementing pattern matching algorithms, and modernizing legacy
          systems. I collaborate with cross-functional teams including product managers, data scientists, and infrastructure
          engineers to deliver reliable, high-performance solutions.

          Previously, I built high-performance data processing systems at nFolks Data Solutions and developed AI-powered health
          applications at Phyt Health. Throughout my career, I've focused on understanding system behavior under production load,
          optimizing performance bottlenecks, and building software that's maintainable and scalable.
